### This project was completed successfully along my masters degree.

#### This project is about predicting the type of star as pulsar star from a HTRU2 dataset which contains various attributes of a star. Binary classifiers namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines were implemented on the dataset to identify the pulsar stars from the dataset. The performance measure values of each classifier were compared to decide the appropriate classifier to predict the pulsar stars.
